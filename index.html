    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Graduates dataset¹ is based off of the National Survey of Recent College Graduates². The dataset includes multiple surveys, each in a different year. It sorts the data by year, and then by major. This dataset is especially useful to determine trends in education, employment opportunities, and salaries of graduate students.</p>
    <h2>Commonly Asked Questions</h2>
